# Random Fact Generator
This app is a website that simply generates a random fact. The purpose of this site was to help me learn more about web development. 
## How To Use
Things You need
- Your own api key from [api-ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)
- node.js installed
### Installation
1. Clone The Repo
2. create a .env file that contains the code `API_KEY = "Your api key here"`
3. run the command `npm install` to install necessary packages
Then You're all set up!
### Execution
simply type `node index.js` to run the site and it should be hosted on port 3000. If port 3000 is in use add another line to the .env file: `PORT = 3001`
## Technologies
For this app I used the following
- node.js/express for backend
- ejs/tailwind for frontend
- [api-ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/) and axios for api
